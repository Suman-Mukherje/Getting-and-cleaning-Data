# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an R script called `run_analysis.R` that performs analysis on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset. The dataset contains data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones worn by subjects performing various activities. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one dataset.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Download the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset from the following link: [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the downloaded file and place the contents in the same directory as the `run_analysis.R` script.
3. Open R or RStudio.
4. Set the working directory to the location where you saved the script and the dataset.
5. Run the script by executing `source("run_analysis.R")`.
