# Code Book

This code book describes the variables in the tidy dataset generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

## Variables

1. `activity`: The type of activity performed by the subject. Possible values are:
   - WALKING
   - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   - SITTING
   - STANDING
   - LAYING

2. `subject`: An identifier for the subject who performed the activity. Ranges from 1 to 30.

3. `time_BodyAcceleration-mean-X`: Mean value of body acceleration along the X-axis in the time domain.

4. `time_BodyAcceleration-mean-Y`: Mean value of body acceleration along the Y-axis in the time domain.

5. `...` (other features omitted for brevity)

## Transformations

- Prefixes such as `time_` and `frequency_` indicate whether the measurements are in the time or frequency domain, respectively.
- `mean`: Mean value of the measurement.
- `std`: Standard deviation of the measurement.
